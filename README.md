# Computer Vision for StanfordAIR's 2018 AUVSI Entry

## Guidelines

To contribute, fork this repository with the 'fork' button at the upper right part of the page and clone it locally (`$ git clone https://github.com/<your username>/vision.git`). You should then see a folder hierarchy identical to the one seen here on GitHub. 

To add your new functional feature here (features in beta should be pushed to vision-playground), add the folder to your local vision repository. The folder's name should reflect the function of your feature (e.g. orientation, cnn) you are developing. Within the folder, include a README.md that gives a quick description, command line or import instuctions for use, as well as any other information you think others on the team should have. If you've used code from another repository, be sure to cite it so that we can inculde it in the final writeup if need be. 

Once you've added your feature, add the changes using `$ git add .`, commit the changes with a commit message using `$ git commit -m "<your message>"`, and push the changes using `$ git push`. Hop back onto GitHub and navigate to your forked repository (github.com/<your username>/vision). There, you should see that you've pushed your changes and be able to create a pull request. Once you've done this, one of us (or you, if you're an admin!) will evaluate and merge it. Congrats, you're a contributor now!
